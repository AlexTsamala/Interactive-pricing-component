### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers


## My process

- functions
- background-picture

### What I learned

I learned how to create input slider and how to manipulate on them.Also i learned how to find css animations and how to put it on my code.



```Css
.slider[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-thumb {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    height: 40px;
    width: 40px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: #10D8C4;
    box-shadow: 0px 15px 30px rgba(0, 255, 231, 0.6);
    cursor: ew-resize;
    cursor: pointer;
    background-image: url(./assets/icon-slider.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position-y: center;
    background-position-x: center;
}

```


### Continued development
 
It was another great project and development for me.Now i am looking to do as much as possible projects like this to feel more and more comfortable and self-confident and then i am going to use back-end development and work with servers and connect front and back sides to each other.I just did this project in 1 day and very excited.
